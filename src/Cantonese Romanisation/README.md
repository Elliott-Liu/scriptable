## Instructions

2. Run the action:

* *Via the ShareSheet*: highlight text, tap share, select "Run Script", tap "Cantonese Romanisation"
* *Via Scriptable app*:

## Accreditation

This wouldn't have been possible without the work from both [dohliam](https://github.com/dohliam) and [hanleyweng](https://github.com/hanleyweng) in their respective repos:

* [CantoJpMin](https://github.com/hanleyweng/CantoJpMin)
* [pingyam-js](https://github.com/dohliam/pingyam-js)

The work I've done here is simply to merge the two projects into one, and make it available for use on the go via the iOS Scriptable app.
