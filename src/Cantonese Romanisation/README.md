# Cantonese Romanization

An iOS Scriptable action to romanize Cantonese text. Fully offline, lightweight, and simple to use!

## Overview

This is a simple Scriptable (JavaScript) action, to romanize Cantonese text based on data from the [Jyutping Workgroup of LSHK](https://github.com/lshk-org/jyutping-table) and [Pingyam database](https://github.com/kfcd/pingyam).

## Accreditation

This wouldn't have been possible without the work from both [dohliam](https://github.com/dohliam) and [hanleyweng](https://github.com/hanleyweng) in their respective repos:

* [CantoJpMin](https://github.com/hanleyweng/CantoJpMin)
* [pingyam-js](https://github.com/dohliam/pingyam-js)

The work I've done here is simply to merge the two projects into one, and make it avaiable for use on the go via the iOS Scriptable app.

## Features

* Supports conversion to eight different forms of romanization (including IPA) - *TBC ability to change this from UI menu*
* Offline
* Lightweight (under 1 MB) size
* Easy to use
