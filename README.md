# Scriptable

## Summary

This repository constains the scripts I've written for Scriptable, and development environment for writing Scriptable scripts in TypeScript. It includes:

- My custom Scriptable [scripts and source code](src/README.md)
- Type definitions generated from Scriptable documentation page
- TypeScript compiler and minifier for Scriptable
- Symlink folder with all your Scriptable files
- **Run taks** (<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>) with predefined scripts to:
  1. Open the current file in Scriptable
  2. Compile the current TypeScript file to JavaScript
  3. Watch the current TypeScript file and compile it to JavaScript when modified

## About

[Scriptable](https://scriptable.app) is an app for iOS and MacOS, that allows you to create widgets and run automations created in JavaScript.

Most of the scripts that can be found in this repo were born out of limitations I've encountered with applications or/and the iOS platform itself; the aim for these scripts is to solve these limitations with elegant solutions.

## Installing scripts

To get started installing scripts in Scriptable go [here](src/README.md).

## Repository navigation

| path        | description                | example                     |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `./src`     | source code                | `.ts` and `readme.md` files |
| `./dist`    | production code            | `.js` Scriptable files      |
| `./scripts` | custom development scripts | compling `.ts` to `.js`     |

## Development environment

### Getting started

How to start developing scriptable apps with VSCode:

1. Download [Scriptable for MacOS](https://scriptable.app/mac-beta/)
2. Enable iCloud sync for Scriptable
3. Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
4. Clone this repository

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Elliott-Liu/scriptable
  ```

5. Open VSCode in the repo

  ```sh
  code .
  ```

6. Run command to initialize a `build` folder symlink to the iCloud Scriptables folder

  ```sh
  ./scriptable.sh init
  ```

  > You can edit files here and changes will show in the Scriptable app.

7. Install npm dependencies

  ```sh
  npm install --include=dev
  ```

### Import your script for git integration

 > IMPORTANT: Script name should not contain any **spaces**, because RUN hotkey will now working

```sh
$ ./scriptable.sh import ScriptName
# or
$ ./scriptable.sh import Script-Name
# or
$ ./scriptable.sh import Script_Name
```

### Notes

When developing in this environment, there are a few things to keep in mind

- When compiling from TypeScript using the `npm run build ${script_name_or_relative_path}` or `npm run build-watch ${script_name_or_relative_path}`, the resulting JavaScript file will be placed in the `dist` folder with the same name (with `.js` as the file extension).
  > Ensure that you actually intend to overwrite any existing files in here before running, or ensure that files are already backed up to `git` before running this command.
