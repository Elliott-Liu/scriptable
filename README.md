## Developing

### Setting up environment

How to start developing scriptable apps with VSCode:

1. Download [Scriptable for MacOS](https://scriptable.app/mac-beta/)
2. Enable iCloud sync for Scriptable
3. Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
4. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Elliott-Liu/scriptable`
5. Open VSCode in the repo: `code .`
6. Run command to initialize a `build` folder symlink to the iCloud Scriptable folder: `npm run init`
7. Install npm dependencies `npm install --include=dev`

### Repository navigation

| path        | description                               | comments                                              |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `./src`     | source code                               | `.ts` and `readme.md` files                           |
| `./dist`    | production code                           | `.js` Scriptable files                                |
| `./scripts` | development scripts                       | additional scripts for compiling `.ts` to `.js`        |
| `./build`   | symbolic link to iCloud Scriptable folder | initialised with npm run init, excluded from git comm |

### Compiling from TypeScript to JavaScript

1. Open a TypeScript file in VSCode.
2. Run a [task](#vscode-tasks) - I'd recommend: `Build, link, and open current script` (this will build the file to the `dist` folder, symlink it to the `build` folder and open it in Scriptable)

### Export script to Scriptable (iCloud directory)

For scripts use:

```node
npm run export
```

For modules use:

```node
npm run export_module
```

### npm

The following commands are for the symbolic linking of files:

#### Init

```node
npm run init
```

#### Export

```node
npm run export
```

#### Export module

```node
npm run export_module
```

These commands are for compiling from TypeScript to JavaScript and running the script in Scriptable. Each should be followed by an argument, either:

- the name of the script (surrounded in quotation marks *if* it contains spaces): e.g. `"Hello World"` or `Hello_World`
- the relative path of the script with file extension (surrounded in quotation marks *if* it contains spaces): e.g. `"./src/Hello World/Hello World.ts"` or `./src/Hello_World/Hello_World.ts`

#### Build

```node
npm run build
```

#### Build and watch

```node
npm run build-watch
```

#### Open

```node
npm run open
```

### VSCode tasks

These are defined in the `.vscode/tasks.json`, they allow you to run a command directly from the current script you're working on.

The default shortcut to run tasks is <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>.

The tasks are relatively self-explanatory and simply pass in the required arguments for the `npm` commands:

- `Open current script in Scriptable`
- `Build current script`
- `Build and watch current script`
- `Build, export, and open current script`

### Notes

When developing in this environment, there are a few things to keep in mind:

- When compiling from TypeScript using the `npm run build` or `npm run build-watch`, the resulting JavaScript file will be placed in the `dist` folder with the same name (with `.js` as the file extension).
  > Ensure that you actually intend to overwrite any existing files in here before running, or/and ensure that files are already backed up to `git` before running this command.
